## A New Start Again

Finally I feel like this is the right time to restart my blog again. I was trying to write something about my understanding of development before I joined Amazon and then I stopped. Not only because I am short of time, I also feel like I don't really understand how things really work in industry. 

Now that I completed my first milestone in Alexa org (yep, it is huge to me as well as to the whole Alexa environment), I think I need a place to write down everything that I learnt and everything that I don't agree. Although I need to draw a very clear boundary between what can be told and what cannot, I can still talk about the main part in tech.

The plan here is to write one page every two weeks or so. So at the end of this year, I probably can write about 20 pages. The contents will be related to 

* How I think about scalability
* How I think about domain driven design (and why people don't want it)
* Some of my side projects (I am planning to start a very small deck building card game)
* Some other feelings of the work here

I might not plug in a comment system or leave my contact here since I don't really want to pay attention to them. This is a very personal place for me.
